# thread_local_collect

This library supports the **_collection_** and **_aggregation_** of thread-local data across threads. An aggregation operation is applied to the collected thread-local values and the resulting accumulated value is made available to the library's caller. This library contains multiple modules, with varying features and constraints. See the documentation for details.
